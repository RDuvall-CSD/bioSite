                One of his favorite ways to relax and wind down after a long day is to play games. Whether it be video games, board games, or even a game of 
solitaire, there is always some kind of game going on in that household at some point during the day. Another favorite past time he has is that 
he likes to care for Orchids and Violets. As of right now he has 7 Â½ Orchids (one has a baby growing off of it and likes to joke that, 
until it can be planted on its own, it counts as half. There is also Star Trek, according to him, there is always time for a little Star Trek.

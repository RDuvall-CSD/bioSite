                                    Sean takes pride in owning every Star Trek movie, every episode of every series, many of the
                                    books, as well as a ton of games and other collectibles. There is so much that the display
                                    case will not fit it all. Due to this, the major items (movies, series, books) all stay on
                                    the shelves, while the smaller collectibles and other random miscellaneous stuff will get
                                    rotated out every now and again.
                                    </p>
                                        
                                    <p>
                                    Sean is proud of the two degrees that he has earned so far: Associate of Science and Associate
                                    of Applied Science, both earned with distinction.
                                    </p>
                                    <p>
                                    Sean can say that he is one of a very small group of regular people (when compared to the total
                                    global population) that have been able to pet and play with penguins.
                                    </p>
                                    <p>
                                    Sean also takes pride in being able to finally pass high school Algebra just in time to be able
                                    to graduate after eveyone tried talking him into dropping out.

                                        Seans biggest goals are to go into space and to be buried in space. When it comes to going to space, there are several
                                        companies to choose from including:
                                        <ul>
                                            <li>Space X</li>
                                            <li>Blue Origin</li>
                                            <li>Virgin Galactic</li>
                                            <li>NASA</li>
                                        </ul>
                                    </p>
                                    <p>
                                        A trip to space right now can range anywhere from hundreds of thousands of dollars to millions
                                        of dollars.
                                    </p>
                                    <br>

                                        As far as being buried in space, there are a couple of different companies that will do this.
                                        Out of them, Sean has chosen Celestis. Celestis is known for sending the ashes of Star Trek actors:

                                            <li>James Doohan - "Montomery Scott"</li>
                                            <li>DeForest Kelley - "Dr. Leonard McCoy"</li>
                                            <li>Nichelle Nichols - "Nyota Uhura"</li>

                                                    <li>"Lwaxana Troi"</li>
                                                    <li>"Voice of the Computer" (Star Trek: TNG - Voyager)</li>
                                                    <li>"Wife of Gene Roddenberry"</li>
                                                </ul>
                                            <li>Gene Roddenberry - Creator of Star Trek</li>
                                            <li>Jon A McBride - Former NASA Astronaut</li>
                                        </ul>
                                    </p>
                                       
                                    <p>
                                        There are numerous packages available through Celestis ranging from $3,000 for a short flight that will return
                                        to Earth, to $13,000 to either put ashes on the Moon or send them into deep space. Sean wants both, but ultimately
                                        if forced to choose, he will pick the deep space option.
                                    </p>

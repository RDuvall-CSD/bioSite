                <h2>About Sean</h2>
                    Sean was born 32 years ago and has grown up watching Star Trek and has on many occasions made it clear that out of all 10 of the actual Star Trek movies, that The Wrath of Khan was the best movie that the franchise ever put out. 
                For being young, he is also kind of old school. While many people will take notes on a phone or on a computer, Sean likes to write them out by hand, and write them in cursive too. If it is written by his hand, and is not required to be printed, then it is written in cursive. His biggest goal in life is to be able to go into space and have a space burial.
                <p>
                    Growing up Sean always had pets. Always cats and dogs. When he was younger, at one point his family had almost 20 cats and a couple of dogs in the house. It was a lot, and it got annoying and smelly sometimes, but according to him he wouldn’t trade it for anything. 
                    According to Sean, the luckiest things that have ever happened to him was running into his wife by chance, years after they failed at dating in high school, and being able to pet and play with Penguins for his wife’s birthday last year. He always says that he has no real regrets. He only wished he had gone to school and gotten his degree right after graduating high school instead of waiting. 
                </p>
                <p>
                He is a simple man and has a few personal rules that are never to be broken:
                    <ol>
                        <li>Think before you speak</li>
                        <li>Always be kind and gentle to animals, and always offer them pets</li>
                        <li>If you cannot take care of yourself, then you are not able to take care of someone else</li>
                    </ol>
                </p> 
                <p>                    
                    When asked to provide 3 interesting facts about himself, the response was interesting:
                    <ol>
                        <li>Sean is horrible at math. It took him 4 years of high school to finally pass Algebra</li>
                        <li>He would leave almost anything in an instant to go to space</li>
                        <li>When he dies, he wants his body to be launched into space</li>
                    </ol>
                </p>
                <p>
                    Finally, as a thought exercise, when asked what three things he would do if he were the last human on earth, he responded with this:
                    <ol>
                        <li>Go Exploring. Nobody to stop him from going to all the places that he wasn’t supposed to be or couldn’t get to</li>
                        <li>Blow stuff up</li>
                        <li>Enjoy the peace</li>
                    </ol>
                </p>
